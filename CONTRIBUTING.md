# Contributing to NovaTurbo AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to NovaTurbo! This is an ambitious open-source project aiming to build an AI-powered micro turbojet engine design system, and we need help from people with diverse expertise.

## Areas Where We Need Help

### 🚀 Aerospace Propulsion
- Combustion chamber design and flame stability modeling
- Turbomachinery aerodynamics (compressor/turbine blade profiles)
- Nozzle flow analysis and thrust vectoring
- Real gas effects at high temperatures
- Multi-spool engine configurations

### 🌊 CFD / Computational Fluid Dynamics
- OpenFOAM or SU2 case templates for turbojet simulations
- Mesh generation for complex internal geometries (TPMS lattice)
- Validation against experimental data
- Turbulence model selection and tuning

### 🔬 Materials & Manufacturing
- High-temperature alloy databases (Inconel 718, Hastelloy X, etc.)
- Temperature-dependent material properties (Cp, k, σ_yield, creep)
- DMLS/SLM print constraints (min wall thickness, overhang angles)
- Build orientation optimization
- Post-processing requirements (HIP, heat treatment)

### 🧠 Machine Learning
- Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)
- Surrogate model architecture improvements
- Uncertainty quantification / ensemble methods
- Active learning strategies
- Generative design approaches (VAE, diffusion models)

### 🎨 Visualization & UI
- Three.js rendering improvements
- WebGL shader effects
- Better simulation overlays
- Design comparison tools

## How to Contribute

### Setting Up

```bash
# Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/novaturbo.git
cd novaturbo

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Generate a small dataset to work with
python app.py --generate 1000

# Launch the viewer
python app.py --ui
```

### Making Changes

1. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Add or update tests in `tests/`
4. Run existing tests: `pytest tests/`
5. Commit with a clear message
6. Push and open a Pull Request

### Code Style

- Python: Follow PEP 8
- JavaScript: ES6+ modules
- Keep functions focused and documented
- Add docstrings for public functions

### Pull Request Guidelines

- Describe what your PR does and why
- Reference any related issues
- Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
- Add tests for new functionality
- Keep PRs focused — one feature/fix per PR

## Project Architecture

```
app.py (CLI) → src/geometry/ (parametric models)
             → src/physics/ (Brayton cycle solver)
             → src/ai/ (PyTorch surrogate + NSGA-II optimizer)
             → src/export/ (STL/STEP output)
             → ui/ (Flask server + Three.js viewer)
```

The neural network surrogate model (MLP, 144K params) is trained on design variants
generated by the parametric geometry + physics pipeline, enabling real-time performance
prediction during optimization.
